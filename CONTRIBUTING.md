## When creating an issue
 - Check if it's a duplicate of a previously posted issue, if this is the case, comment in the previous issue instead.
 
## When creating a pull request
 - Unless it's a very minor fix, create an issue to discuss the feature before submitting a PR
 - You're encouraged to create the PR early and tag it with [WIP] and link to the issue (Aiming to fix: #[issue_number]). This is so others can see that a feature is beeing worked on. When you want a review, remove the [WIP] tag and write a message where you tag one of the maintainers (@kjetilkjeka).
